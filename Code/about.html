            In 1982, Nicholas and Tina Cocca opened the first Cocca's pizza located in Boardman, OH.  Always believing that family came first, the Cocca's had no issue finding their target consumers: families.  Since the fall out of the economy, it became evident that feeding a family at an affordable price was posing a challenge.  Nick and Tina predicted right.  Pizza sales skyrocketed because of the many option, great taste, and affordability.  It is no surprise that the pizza industry in the U.S continues to grow at 70,000 pizzerias.
